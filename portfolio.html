            <h2 style="margin-left: 25px">Zettelkasten</h2>
            <h3 style="margin-left: 50px">Introduction</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px">While working on large projects, I constantly need to seek out and incorporate new information into my workflow. 
              I often suffered from a cluttered workspace, littered with books, articles, and sticky notes. That changed once I began reflecting on the 
              process of knowledge acquisition and maintenance itself. I began exploring what techniques others used for personal knowledge management, eventually 
              choosing Niklas Luhmann’s  <i>Zettelkasten</i> technique. This note-taking system relies on the user to take notes, not only on the content of new 
              information, but also on how that information relates to one’s other projects and ideas. In other words, a <i>Zettelkasten</i> is similar to a personal 
              knowledge wiki. On numerous occasions, I have attempted to convey the usefulness of the <i>Zettelkasten</i> technique to my colleagues; therefore, I decided 
              to make a <i>Zettelkasten</i> Instructional Design project in <b>Articulate Storyline.</b></p>
            <img style="margin-left: 25px" src="img/ZK_Map.png">
            <p style="margin-left: 50px">The above image is a visual representation of my current Zettelkasten. I use it to develop new ideas, take notes on what 
              I am reading, and organize my thoughts during and between projects. </p>
            <img style="margin-left: 50px; margin-bottom: 1%; float: left; max-width: 95%;" src="img/ZKall.gif">
      
            <p style="margin-left: 50px; float:left;">Using <b>Articulate Storyline</b>, I have been able to create an interactive learning experience that showcases the 
            <i>Zettelkasten</i> concept. I begin by inviting the participant to reflect on their current habits of organizing information (above bottom left). From there, 
            I point out some potential flaws of common methods of organizing information before offering the <i>Zettelkasten</i> method as a productive alternative.
            Then, I expand on the particulars of the method, showcasing the workflow that captures information with "Fleeting Notes," organizes it with "Literature Notes," and 
            finally puts it to an original use with "Permanent Notes" (above bottom right).</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 75px"><b>Fleeting Notes</b> - Temporary notes that capture ideas one has throughout the day. You can write these in a notebook, but anything 
            will do: napkins, receipts, etc. The most important thing about Fleeting Notes is to collect them all in one spot so you can process them regularly, turning them into 
            Literature Notes or Permanent Notes.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 75px"><b>Literature Notes</b> - When you read something, you make notes about the content with a Literature Note. Write down things that 
            you want to remember or information that might prove useful for a later project. These notes need to be extremely selective; remember, Niklas Luhmann used slips of 
            paper no bigger than a notecard.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 75px"><b>Permanent Notes</b> - With Fleeting Notes and Literature Notes in hand, you can now turn to Permanent Notes. Think about how the 
            thoughts and information you recorded relate to your work. The idea here is not to collect ideas, but to develop them and expand them.</p>


            <img style="margin-left: 50px; max-width: 95%;" src="img/ZK4.png">

            <p style="margin-left: 50px">In contrast with my previous experience with PowerPoint, I find that <b>Articulate Storyline</b> offers an especially useful 
            <i>Story View</i> to help storyboard the project and envision it in its entirety. I hope that my presentation of the <i>Zettelkasten</i> technique can 
            convince learners of its merits and improve the way they approach personal knowledge management.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-left: 25px">German Instructor</h2>
              <h3 style="margin-left: 50px">Introduction</h3>
                <p style="margin-left: 50px">As an instructor of college-level German language and culture, my experience with instructional design (ID) 
                  revolved around the end-goal of teaching a classroom of students how to speak German. To achieve this, I used a communicative, learner-centered 
                  approach that maximized instructional time by conducting the entirety of the 55-minute class in the target language. </p>
                <p style="margin-left: 50px">Although my approach to ID outside of academia would addresses a different kind of learning goal, I still find an approach that gives the learner 
                  hands-on experience of the material extremely compelling.
                </p>
              <h3 style="margin-left: 50px">Instructor-Led PowerPoint</h3>
                <p style="margin-left: 50px">When creating such a presentation, I keep the following in mind (please, follow along with the PPT below):
                </p>
                <p style="margin-left: 75px"><b>1.</b> When teaching a new skill like a foreign language, proper signposting and scaffolding is imperative; therefore, I begin 
                  and end the lessons by clarifying the “learning goals” (<i>Learnziele</i>) for the session. 
                </p>
                <p style="margin-left: 75px"><b>2.</b> Many lessons begin with the acquisition of new vocabulary and terminology. In this presentation on sports, 
                  I found it helpful to begin with something familiar; German has a number of words for sports that are identical to their English counterparts. 
                  Following this, I introduce less familiar vocabulary, repeating each word aloud for my students and prompting them to repeat it. While average 
                  learners can absorb at most seven new pieces of information in one session, I introduce ten new words since I will work with similar 
                  information for the remainder of the week.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-left: 75px"><b>3.</b> Before putting the new vocabulary to use, I include a review slide. Without the accompanying words, I quiz 
                  the students briefly on the new vocabulary. 
                </p>
                <p style="margin-left: 75px"><b>4.</b> Following this, I present the students with two videos to exercise their listening skills. I assess their understanding by 
                  asking questions about each video's content.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-left: 75px"><b>5.</b> For the remainder of the presentation, I focus on having the students speak as much as possible. For each dialogue 
                  or question, I first model the interaction for the students, then turn the activity over to them. Note how each activity becomes gradually more reliant 
                  on the learners’ memory; earlier activities provide a word bank for reference, while later ones do not.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-left: 75px"><b>6.</b> By the end of the presentation, the students are growing comfortable with the new sports vocabulary; therefore, 
                  I combine the new words with older structures for review. 
                </p>

              <h3 style="margin-left: 50px">Learning Management System Structure</h3>
                <p style="margin-left: 50px;">I used Canvas LMS to organize the course’s files, communicate with students, facilitate discussions, and evaluate 
                  student progress. When organizing the materials for language courses, I divided course content into weekly modules for ease of access. 
                </p>
                <p style="margin-left: 50px;">The integration of Echo 360 with Canvas LMS enabled me to stream class live to absent students and to record classes
                  for later reference. This was an invaluable asset during the pandemic. It allowed class to be in an in-person format for healthy students and 
                  in a temporarily hybrid format for those absent.
                </p>

              <h3 style="margin-left: 50px">Self-Paced Materials</h3>
                <p style="margin-left: 50px">While teaching Ohio State’s Individual Instruction German course, I took initiative to update the individual instruction 
                  system to the (at the time) newly implemented Canvas LMS. Prior to my intervention, student evaluations were tabulated manually, costing department 
                  personnel a great deal of time. In Canvas LMS, I was able to create self-grading quizzes which only required instructor intervention on select questions, 
                  if at all. The LMS's built-in discrimination index was especially useful when analyzing whether questions were effective at evaluating student performance.

              <h2 style="margin-left: 25px">Dissertation</h2>
                <p style="margin-left: 50px">While working on my dissertation, I honed numerous soft-skills that contribute to my ability as an effective instructional designer. </p>
                <p style="margin-left: 50px">In order to ensure my understanding of complex subject matter, I often employed the Feynman Technique (e.g. ensuring that I 
                  could articulate my understanding to someone else). I have transferred my experience with the Feynman Technique into classroom activities numerous times 
                  to great success. This method not only checks for learner understanding, but often deepens and reinforces the knowledge of those who have begun to grasp 
                  the material. </p>

                  <p style="margin-left: 50px">During my doctoral research, I first came across the <i>Zettelkasten</i> technique described above. I have been implementing it
                  and improving on its execution since then.</p>


                <p style="margin-left: 50px">Though its content does not pertain to my application, please accept my dissertation as evidence of my ability to pursue 
                  complex projects:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 75px">In my dissertation, “Melancholy and the Photo-Historical Approach in the Films of Wim Wenders,” I examine the influence 
                  of the thinkers of “redemptive realism” on Wenders’ work. Through this thematic and formal engagement with melancholy—understood as a combination of 
                  social isolation and self-estrangement that cyclically perpetuates itself—Wenders enters into a discussion about photographic mediation that spans the 
                  twentieth century. While Béla Balázs, Walter Benjamin, Roland Barthes, and Rudolf Arnheim contribute to this discourse, I root my understanding of 
                  melancholy primarily in the film theory with which Wenders is most familiar, in particular, Siegfried Kracauer’s Theory of Film: The Redemption of 
                  Physical Reality and his subsequent work, which expands on film’s relationship to time, History: The Last Things Before the Last. This theoretical 
                  perspective that I call the “redemptive realist tradition” emphasizes film’s documentary capability to mediate an encounter with phenomena that would 
                  otherwise elude perception, thereby “redeeming” them in Kracauer’s vocabulary through what I call his “photo-historical approach.” I find that this 
                  approach and the process of resolving melancholy parallel one another, thereby offering Wenders’ characters the chance to redeem the phenomena of their 
                  perception while overcoming their estrangement and isolation. </p>
