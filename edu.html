          <h1>Educator, Writer, German Specialist</h1>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Greetings! My name is Bill Baker. Since 2013, I have been teaching German language and culture at the college level. Last year, I was a Full-Time Instructor
               at the University of Kentucky. During my graduate studies at Ohio State, I taught introductory and graduate German language as well as co-designed and 
               co-taught cultural courses addressing film and literature.
            </p>
            <p>I dedicate a lot of my time to reading in a broad range of topics, everything from history and philosophy to HTML and Python programming. I am 
              always interested in learning new information and acquiring new skills. In order to organize and digest this new information, I maintain a 
              <i>Zettelkasten</i> for the sake of personal knowledge management. 
            </p>
            <p>I enjoy learning new languages. In undergraduate, I majored in German and Russian with a minor in Linguistics. From there, I studied Japanese during graduate 
              school and began studying Mandarin in 2018. In addition to maintaining my language skills, I am currently working to acquire speaking and reading proficiency 
              in French.
            </p>
          <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
            <p>My motivation as a language teacher is to foster an atmosphere of critical reflection in which I can encourage my students to pursue their own linguistic 
              and cultural interests. Last year, I was a Full-Time Instructor at the University of Kentucky teaching six German language classes. During my graduate studies 
              at Ohio State, I taught introductory and graduate German language as well as co-designed and co-taught cultural courses addressing film, literature, and the 
              Holocaust. In the language classroom, I draw strongly from the communicative approach and my own insights as an avid language learner in order to guide my 
              students on their journey toward linguistic fluency and cultural communicative competence. My evaluations and peer reviews attest to the success of my approach, 
              describing my classes as “well organized,” “knowledgeable,” and possessing a “professional, yet approachable” learning atmosphere. With over six years of 
              experience teaching German, I have expertise in teaching introductory language courses, independent instruction courses, and online courses as were necessitated 
              by COVID-19. Although the transition to online teaching was challenging, my technological literacy enabled me to capitalize on the strengths of online 
              instruction; while teaching on Zoom, I simultaneously notated my slides with a drawing tablet while presenting, thereby bringing the flexibility of a 
              traditional chalkboard into the online space. Furthermore, having worked with a wide range of instructional materials—including <i>Berliner Platz</i>, 
              <i>Netzwerk</i>, <i>Deutsch im Blick</i>, and <i>Jannach’s German for Reading Knowledge</i>—I am experienced at evaluating and selecting instructional 
              materials for use in the classroom.</p>

              <p>I model my conception of teaching on my experience as a Boy Scout. Prior to achieving the rank of Eagle, Scouts must—among other things—participate 
                in an interview with their Scout leaders. In my interview, our Scoutmaster explained that, in his role as a mentor to a troop of high school boys, he 
                expected to impart more wisdom than he received in return. He went on to describe how, as an educator one cannot expect repayment from one’s students, 
                but rather teach with the expectation that they will pay their education “forward” rather than pay it back. By “paying forward,” he meant that we, his 
                Scouts, would eventually become mentors ourselves, with our own students, to whom we would impart our knowledge. In the following years, I noticed that 
                a large number of my fellow Scouts worked as high school teachers, professors, coaches, and instructors. As I look back on my experience as a Boy Scout, 
                I see the origin of my interest in education as both a profession and a way of life. Although I only know of a few of my own students who have continued 
                studying German to fluency, I find it extremely fulfilling to know that my students use the skills I teach them, regardless of their skill level.</p>

              <p>When preparing for language classes, I create assignments that progressively become more challenging, building on previous activities and lessons. 
                This graduated approach meshes well with the immersive communicative environment of a class taught primarily in our target language. By maximizing the 
                student’s exposure to German—through partner interaction, media, or instructor presentations—I aim to accelerate the students’ acquisition of new 
                vocabulary and grammar structures. When I teach grammar, I begin by first introducing the material implicitly, then clarifying explicitly only if necessary. 
                When preparing presentations and activities for my students, I ensure to present them with visual, aural, and written tasks in order to effectively address 
                a classroom of diverse learning styles.</p>

              <p>I regularly integrate cultural topics and products into the classroom activities and discussions since linguistic proficiency and cultural communicative 
                competence go hand-in-hand. My students can easily relate to cultural products that they enjoy (e.g. music videos, films, popular culture), thereby gaining 
                listening practice and cultural insights under the guise of entertainment. Since more complex media may be too difficult for lower language levels, I take 
                care to select digestible excerpts for use in class, providing scaffolding when necessary. As an added benefit, if students find the music or films 
                enlightening as well as entertaining, they are more likely to voluntarily continue their studies outside of the classroom. To create further educational 
                moments, I actively promote extracurricular activities like German Club and German speaking events. When time permits, I like to attend these events as 
                well to see how my students use the language to interact on their own and to learn more about their interests.</p>

              <p>By becoming familiar with my students (their fields of study, their interests, their hobbies, their goals, their strengths, and their weaknesses), I 
                aim to foster a classroom atmosphere that invites students to partake in group activities without feeling self-conscious or fearing failure. As an avid 
                language learner, I have found time and again that making a fool of oneself while studying a language is inevitable, if not an integral part of the learning 
                process. For this reason, it is extremely important that my students feel comfortable expressing themselves in class.</p>







            <p>I am excited about the prospect of bringing my talents to a new position. Please find my résumé, dissertation, and LinkedIn at the links below.</p>
